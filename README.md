## A.Personal introduction
My name is Elmare Johaneson. I am a Bsc(Hons). Computer Science at UWC who overcomes challenges through a tenacious and questioning approach - drawing on wide-ranging technical expertise. I bring a creative component to problem solving and strive to create new and effective ways to optimise my solutions. I plan to enter the workforce, upon completion of my studies,  as a capable software developer.
